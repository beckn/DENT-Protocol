## Overview
Microgrid aggregation enables the discovery and utilization of distributed energy storage resources (batteries) to store excess energy from energy producers. This creates a more efficient and resilient energy ecosystem by allowing energy producers to store excess energy during peak production periods and retrieve it when needed.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Battery discovery and selection
- Energy storage contract creation
- Real-time monitoring of storage capacity
- Payment and settlement for storage services
- Status tracking and updates
- Support and maintenance

### Out of Scope
- Physical battery installation
- Battery maintenance services
- Grid infrastructure modifications
- Hardware-level integrations

## Workflow

### Process Flow
1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Energy producer searches for available storage capacity
   - Battery providers return catalog of available batteries
   - Producer reviews and selects suitable storage options

2. **Contract Phase**
   - Producer initiates storage contract
   - Provider confirms terms and pricing
   - Contract finalization and activation

3. **Operation Phase**
   - Energy transfer to storage begins
   - Real-time monitoring and status updates
   - Capacity management and optimization

4. **Settlement Phase**
   - Usage calculation and verification
   - Invoice generation
   - Payment processing
   - Reconciliation
